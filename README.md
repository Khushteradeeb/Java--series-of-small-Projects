# Java--series-of-small-Projects
I am starting a new series of Java minor-projects.

# Investment-Earning is the first minor-project where "Driver" class has these features-
1. Enter the buying price per share.
2• Enter closing price on subsequent days.
3• Calculate aggregate earnings/losses after each day.
4• Leave program when closing price is negative.

# Budget allocation can do do these-
1• Enter your budget.
2• Enter the proportion of each expenses item.
3• Ignore further items if proportion exceeds 100%.
4• Use ArrayList to store expense proportions.
5• Find the amount for each item.
